Hi everyone! My name is Guillermo although some people call me G for simplicity. I'm a dedicated and highly motivated Digital Media Software Engineering student at Ferris State University, with a passion for crafting technology solutions that make a difference. I am graduating in August 2024 but I already had some fun working in some projects. Feel free to take a look at my profile and connect with me. I am also a soccer fan and a photography geek!

🎓 Education

Digital Media Software Engineering @Ferris State University (August 2024)
IEEE Student Member | Dean's List 2022-2023

🛠️ Projects and Experience

• Developed a Python-based application in a group project utilizing TensorFlow and deep neural networks algorithm to achieve 91% accuracy in predicting between AI-generated and authentic images in machine learning class. The project was showcased at the course faculty conference. Later on, I improved the accuracy to a 93% and implemented the algorithm to be a Telegram bot that tells you if an image is real or made by Skynet (Run Sarah Connor!). Checkout the Telegram bot that I created using the algorithm!

• Designed, developed, and presented using Tableau, a web application for PC components sales, employing a React frontend and Spring backend, integrated with MariaDB. Implemented robust security measures using JWT.

• Collaborated with the DevOps team during my summer internship to create a Python and Selenium automation tool, which streamlined error resolution for complex job executions by automating API calls, significantly enhancing the web application's overall functionality.

• Designed and developed features for a startup project in Python to deliver real-time updates for fleet management, incorporating API calls to track their precise locations and developed a React front-end application to provide a user-friendly interface, offering real-time visualization of fleet locations on an interactive map.
