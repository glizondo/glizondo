👤 About me 👤

Hi everyone! My name is Guillermo although some people call me G for simplicity. I'm a dedicated and highly motivated Digital Media Software Engineering student at Ferris State University, with a passion for crafting technology solutions that make a difference. I am graduating in August 2024 but I already had some fun working in some projects. Feel free to take a look at my profile and connect with me. I am also a soccer fan and a photography geek!

🛠️ Projects and Experience 🛠️

• Developed a Python-based application in a group project utilizing TensorFlow and deep neural networks algorithm to achieve 91% accuracy in predicting between AI-generated and authentic images in machine learning class. The project was showcased at the course faculty conference. Later on, I improved the accuracy to a 93% and implemented the algorithm to be a Telegram bot that tells you if an image is real or made by Skynet (Run Sarah Connor!). Checkout the Telegram bot that I created using the algorithm!

• Gathered project requirements and conceptualized a web application dedicated to Orchard tree management, employing Figma for design planning. Developed the frontend using React to ensure an intuitive and responsive user interface for seamless tree tracking.
You can take a look at it thanks to gh-pages here! 


• Designed, developed, and presented using Tableau, a web application for PC components sales, employing a React frontend and Spring backend, integrated with MariaDB. Implemented robust security measures using JWT.

• Collaborated with the DevOps team during my summer internship to create a Python and Selenium automation tool, which streamlined error resolution for complex job executions by automating API calls, significantly enhancing the web application's overall functionality.

• Designed and developed features for a startup project in Python to deliver real-time updates for fleet management, incorporating API calls to track their precise locations and developed a React front-end application to provide a user-friendly interface, offering real-time visualization of fleet locations on an interactive map.
